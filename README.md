# Nicole Danuwidjaja Website 2020

Oops -- new year, new website?

##### Technologies: Next.js, Sass

(Will be) Deployed on [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co/download)

Dev server: `npm run dev`

## Benefits of Next.js
**SERVER-side rendering** is a beautiful thing!

Because I would like this portfolio website to be as responsive as possible, choosing Next.js seemed to be the most logical move for pre-rendering website content in order to expedite loading time.

Comes packaged with a deployable **server**, so this website can be dynamic and run on Node.js platforms.

**Dynamic content** with `router` for a potential blog!
